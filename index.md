I am currently working as a Research Associate in the [Public Health Modelling Group](http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk/research/modelling/) based at [MRC Epidemiology Unit](http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, UK. I am working on [TIGTHAT project](http://www.cedar.iph.cam.ac.uk/research/modelling/tigthat/), which will lay the scientific foundations of a health impact assessment tool that will estimate health impacts of transport choices applicable in a wide variety of urban settings around the world. Within this project, I am:

1) testing the use of Google Street View to estimate travel patterns  

2) analysing road traffic injuries in low- and middle-income settings, and their association with travel patterns 

3) studying how cycling behaviour varies across cities in the world.

I completed my PhD at Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme, based at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. With a transport planning background, I developed methods of data collection and modelling to estimate public health burden of transport, with Delhi as a case study. My main thesis outputs include:      
  
1. [data collection and statistical methods to estimate vehicular characteristics of on-road modes](http://www.urbanemissions.info/wp-content/uploads/docs/2014-11-TBS-Delhi-Veh&Pass-Characteristics.pdf)  Media coverage in [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Ban-on-petrol-diesel-vehicles-in-Delhi-Centre-moves-NGT-seeking-stay/articleshow/47071807.cms), [Firstpost](http://www.firstpost.com/delhi/centre-favours-ban-15-year-old-diesel-vehicles-delhi-ncr-2250648.html)  

2. [development of a dynamic bottom-up traffic emission inventory model and longitudinal assessment (40 years-- 1990 to 2030) of traffic emissions in Delhi](http://www.urbanemissions.info/wp-content/uploads/docs/2015-01-AE-Delhi-Vehicle-Emissions-1990-2030.pdf)  

3. [on-road exposure of PM2.5 pollution in 11 transport modes in Delhi](http://www.urbanemissions.info/wp-content/uploads/docs/2015-12-AE-Delhi-On-Road-Exposures.pdf)  Media coverage in  [Indian Express](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/findings-of-iit-led-study-on-delhi-commuters-exposed-to-high-pollution-levels-cyclists-are-worst-hit/) 

4. space-time integrated PM2.5 exposure assessment at population level  


During my PhD, I was also engaged in various funded projects of which some outputs include:  

1. [detailed study of revenue, passenger travel characteristics and safety audit of infrastructure around bus]()-- [journal publication](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1ib3oxqoxqurl4/Goel%20and%20Tiwari%202015%20-%20%20access%20trips%20metro%20delhi.pdf?dl=0)  

2. [assessment of on-road vehicular charactetistics for emission analysis in three Indian cities](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h6cjegt1jajowui/Goel%20et%20al%202016%20-%20vehicle%20characteristics%20three%20Indian%20cities.pdf?dl=0)  

3. [evaluation of odd-even policy implemented in Delhi](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u2k0k4d9qg69z3w/Mohan%20et%20al%202017%20odd-even%20evaluation%20delhi.pdf?dl=0)   Media Coverage in [Indian Express](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/iit-delhi-study-on-odd-even-phase-i-average-speeds-fell-in-morning-peak-hours-early-start-seen-as-key-factor/)


I am also interested in understanding how road traffic injury burden relates with travel pattern. I have recently done following work: 

1. [ecological analysis in Great Britain to assess safety-in-numbers for cyclists](http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2017/11/30/injuryprev-2017-042498)  

2. [small-area analysis of road fatalities of vulnerable road users in Delhi](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321244033_Correlates_of_fatality_risk_of_vulnerable_road_users_in_Delhi?_iepl%5BviewId%5D=dBKajR1pfCiYZMwNbeckJsN5&_iepl%5BprofilePublicationItemVariant%5D=default&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=prfpi&_iepl%5BtargetEntityId%5D=PB%3A321244033&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationTitle)  

3. state-level analysis of road deaths in India  

4. district-level spatio-temporal analysis of road deaths in vaious states of India (in progress)  

5. [Rajasthan case study linking tourism with road fatalities (ongoing)](https://rahulatiitd.github.io/page_a.html)
